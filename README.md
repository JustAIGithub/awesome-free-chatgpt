The following table contains several unofficial websites (reverse proxies) for using [OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) with for free. The following chat models can be used (depends on site):
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` (allows max. 4,096 input tokens)
- `gpt-4` (allows max. 8,192 input tokens)
- `gpt-4-32k` (allows max. 32,768 input tokens)

## Working ChatGPT proxy websites (no account/API key required)
All of them respond in English, too (even if the website itself is in Chinese).

The table only represents the features of the free version of the website. Some websites offer a paid version with more features.

*GPT-4 support needs more testing to confirm. Feel free to contribute by creating a pull request and explaining how you tested it.

**English**: has an (mostly at least) English version of the website available. On Chanzhaoyu dashboards, you can set the language in `Settings` -> `Language`.

**GUI**: User interface the website uses

**Custom Sys. Prompt**: Allows you to set a custom system prompt, sometimes called "role". On chat.zuhlei.xyz, you can open the settings menu and set `系统角色指令` (the fourth option) to your desired value. On omg.ck9.us, set 角色 in the top bar to your desired system prompt.

⚙️ means that the website already set a custom system prompt (for example, it doesn't say it's ChatGPT, but says the website's name) and it's not possible to change it.

**Custom Temp.** - Allows you to customize the temperature

## Mirrors
This means that the website has multiple domains that point to the same website. This is useful if one of the domains is blocked.

## Disclaimer

Please note that these unofficial "proxies" are not maintained, developed or made by OpenAI!

They are especially useful if you are a researcher/journalist in a country where ChatGPT is forbidden and you need to access it, still.

This project is not affiliated to or maintained by OpenAI. Please make sure to read and follow their terms of service!

**Tip:** install uBlock Origin, Brave or any other ad-blocker to protect from the extensive ads on these websites :)

Some of these websites are in Chinese, but don't worry - I don't understand any Chinese myself and only chose websites I still found easy to use.

Moreover, I only chose websites where the AI responds in English, too.
